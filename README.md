# Portfolio Website
A project that I took on to create my personal portfolio website, built on Flask with design inspiration taken from [Raj Shekhar's project](https://github.com/rajshekhar26/cleanfolio-minimal/). This project is centered around building a website that is accessible, clear and describes myself clearly and consicley.
